                <p class="writing-text">I understand that it could be very nerve racking to see a stock that you've just bought go down big and it could be very tempting to sell to avoid a big loss. However, I think this is a very ineffective approach to investing and it's not very smart either.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">I have definitely been in those situations before, I've been a panic seller and based on my experience, I never really got much out of it other than a short-lived feeling of relief and a bunch of negative thoughts about having to take a loss on a stock I was so sure would go up. But, again, nothing very positive came out of that except more panic selling because "it worked" last time and I didn't take that big of a loss.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">It does make sense to just cut your losses on a stock that isn't as good as you thought it was, when something has fundamentally changed in the underlying business that isn't very favorable for it at all, or that the business is just going downhill in general.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">These could be some very good reasons to cut your losses as an investor, but what I don't understand is why people buy some random stock they know nothing about, they haven't done the research, they don't understand the business, they buy just because someone else bought it, or uncle Jim recommended it and neighbor Frank says he bought it too because he saw it on some clickbait advertisement on the internet A lot of the time, the deciding factor for making the purchase of the stock will simply boil down to "It's moving up so maybe it's good."</p>
                <p class="writing-text">Panic selling is likely to be one of the leading causes of losses in the stock market. You buy a stock, you didn't do any research for it and you have no idea what the heck is going on with that stock or what the business is really about, but you saw it going up and you thought "Well, it's probably going to keep moving up, I'll buy it!" Just to have see it fall shortly after.</p>

                <p class="writing-text"><b>Quick Thought</b></p>
                <p class="writing-text"><i>So let's say you've put in the work and you've done all of the research you could on a stock and you really like what you're seeing. You like the business, you like the management team, their financial position, their competitive advantage in the market, and you think the business has a lot of potential for growth long term. If you believe that business is good and you believe you'll make some good returns and at least double your money within the next 5-10 years or so, why would you sell it because the stock drops $20? In situations where a stock I've bought drops below the price I bought it for, I really like the business, I believe in it long term, and don't plan on selling any time soon, I'll just buy more shares. Easy and simple! I would would be delighted to see Google stock drop big. That's just a bunch of short term thinkers selling me the stock for cheaper and cheaper. I'll take a discount any day!</i></p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">When it comes to investing, I'm not a big fan of buying random stocks and selling quickly so you don't lose money when they go down. A crappy approach to the market will get you nothing but crappy results, I've done just that and it brought me nothing but losses (Thank goodness for tax write offs). You will greatly decrease the odds of having to take a loss on a crappy stock when you put in the time and effort to research that company as best you can to find out whether or not it's worth the purchase. Always buy businesses that you really believe in and wouldn't be afraid to hold if the market crashes 20% or we enter a recession. I say this very often, that you should be buying stocks that allow you to sleep well at night. You shouldn't panic sell simply because the stock went down 5% if you really believe in the underlying business. It's very important because it's impossible to predict what the stock market is going to do tomorrow. You can have a big rally a correction, a big crash, or a recession, you never know. This is why you should have a long term outlook and focus on the underlying business behind that stock. A big mistake I made was thinking of a stock as some sqwiggly line on a chart that moves up and down all the time.</p>

                <p class="writing-text">I firmly believe that it is very important to have a very logical and open-minded approach to investing in the stock market. Bad things happen to those that invest with emotion but to be honest that's not really investing, rather it's just the same attitude most people bring to the casino. Nothing good comes out of being an emotional thinker rather than a logical one.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">A lot of people would be very happy to buy an expensive pair of shoes that are selling at a discount, so why wouldn't you do the same for stocks? If a business is selling for way less than it's worth (assuming it's good), you buy it. If Google [Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&.tsrc=fin-srch">GOOG</a> or <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL?p=GOOGL&.tsrc=fin-srch">GOOGL</a>)] dropped from $1,400 per share all the way down to $1,000 per share, I'm buying it. Everyone else is just selling their stock to me at less than they bought it for. Think about that for a moment. Imagine buying a house for $500,000 today, there's a drop in the housing market and your house is only worth $400,000. You're not going to sell that thing at a bargain price to someone else are you? If you buy a good business, take advantage of large drops in price, because you'll be the logical thinker, profiting off the emotional thinkers that are selling to you a $1,400 GOOG for $1,000. That's why they say that profits are made when you buy, not when you sell (think about it) and that is absolutely true!</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">Remember that <i>the stock market is a place where the gains come to the logical thinkers that can profit off the emotional thinkers.</i> Again, It's important to keep in mind that a good investor makes their money when they buy a stock, not when they sell it. Buy or sell a stock where it makes sense to do so instead of buying or selling based on where the price is or where you think the price is going to go next Monday.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">So let's say you've put in the work and you've done all of the research you could on a stock and you really like what you're seeing.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The market shouldn't be a casino where you go to buy random stocks because you see them moving up in price and panic selling because there is a drop in price. You likely wouldn't do that for most other things you buy, so why do it with stocks? Buy what you understand and buy good businesses at a good price. Panic selling just creates more fear and more panic selling in the market that just compounds into more and more selling. For every loss that you take, there is someone out there profiting off your loss. When you combine FOMO with short term thinking, you'll end up with the mentality of the majority. But this usually leads to disappointment when the stock does exactly what you didn't want it to do, you take a loss, you get discouraged, and you feel like the stock market is a scam or something. It's so common to hear "buy low, sell high", but always see people buying high and selling low for some strange reason. At the end of the day, all of this just comes from ignorance. Warren Buffett isn't ignorant, that's why he doesn't do the crap most people do, and that's exactly why he's winning!</p>
