                <p class="writing-text">As I say all the time, you need to understand a business before you invest in it. You do this by reading their annual reports. When you take a look at a company's 10-k that they will release annually at the end of the forth quarter of their fiscal year, one of the first things that will be on that form is the company's business model. This will basically tell you what they do, what they're all about, and how the business operates, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Why Is It Important?</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">When you're reading the business section of the 10-k, you're looking out for a couple of things. First, is do you understand it? When you're reading the business section of a company such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) for example, you're going to be looking out for what their product is, what it does or how it benefits their customers, and of course, see if you understand the product and what it does. Can you wrap your head around why that product is so impactful and how that product stands out from all of the other products from other companies that may have a very similar type of product.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">For example, take a company like Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). When you read the portion of the 10-k that goes over their business model, you'd try and figure out what is Facebook all about. You'll find that Facebook is a tech giant that owns two of the largest social media platforms i.e. Facebook and Instagram. You'll also find that they own other apps related to messaging i.e. Messenger and Whatsapp, and they're in the VR space with their Oculus VR headset. But that's not all! You'll also find that their biggest business isn't actually the social media platforms themselves, it's advertising. Facebook makes the vast majority of their revenues from advertising. So from there you'd try to figure out, okay, well what advantage does Facebook have over its competitors in the social media and advertising space? Well, when it comes to social media and streaming would be Google (owns YouTube), Twitter, Inc., Snap, Inc. (parent company behind Snapchat), Bytedance (who owns TikTok), and Amazon.com, Inc. (owns Twitch and is a major player in advertising). Does Facebook's family of products have an advantage over its competition? Another really big question you should be asking yourself is, again, do you understand Facebook's business? Do you understand what their product is, how it works, what risk factors would affect the product, what events would harm their business more than others, what are they more susceptible too, and will their product be able to stay on top of all the others because of its competitive advantage?</p>
                <p class="writing-text">These are the basic things you should be looking out for when you're looking into a company's business model. Obviously, this could change a bit from business to business and you might have to do quite a bit more research or less research depending on what that business does. A financial institution's business model, weaknesses, risk factors, and advantages or disadvantages might be totally different from a business such as Facebook, for example, so your research would change a bit depending on the company you're looking into. Some businesses will require a bit more time and research to fully understand their business. It's certainly much more confusing and tricky to look into a bank's business model, like a Geico or a Wells Fargo, compared to something like Coca-Cola.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">When You're Done, You're Not Done</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The last thing you need to keep in mind is that when you're done, you understand their business  model and you think you're ready to go, you're not done. Once you've gone through the business model of the company you're interested in, you're also going to look at the business models of all other possible publicly traded competitors that company has. For example, take a company such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), who's business model consists of advertising (Google Ads and AdSense), search (Google Search), streaming (YouTube), G Suite (Gmail, DOCS, Calendar, etc.), internet services (Google Fiber), Google Cloud, operating systems with Android, and some other smaller services Google offers. We could also include social media with Google+, but who uses that these days. You may understand their business model, but they have competition, so you have to go out there and research the business models of all other possible competitors. For Google, this may include companies such as Apple (IOS and Apple Tv), Microsoft (with Bing for search and LinkedIn for search and social media), Disney (Disney +), Netflix with streaming, Amazon (AWS, advertising, Amazon Prime Video, and Twitch), Alibaba (e-commerce and advertising), and AT&T with their internet services. All of these are companies w ith business models that will be competition for Google. It's  important that you go through the annual reports of all of their competitors as well so you understand what can affect Google's business. I know this will be very time consuming, but it's something you have to do and there's no way around it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">You'll definitely save yourself a lot of headaches in the future because of not knowing whether or not your business would survive a recession because you don't understand it if you just simply read through these annual reports and really try to understand the business model. This is probably one of the most important things you can do before you buy a single share, is understanding the business. This is is something I try to do as well whenever I think of buying a business. A good example of this would be Skyworks Solutions. I bought this stock when the market was first starting to drop, the market hadn't yet made any huge moves to the downside, but it was still quite substantial for individual stocks. I didn't really understand the ins and outs of the business and I hadn't yet done the full research. However, I did look into their business model, I've read the annual reports, watched the videos on their website, and researched the topic of 5G quite a bit, and I was blown away by the potential of this company. Again, I didn't do all the research and there was still quite a bit I didn't know, but I knew what the business model and that is a very important start. Obviously, you want to do all of the research you can before you buy, but in this this situation, I started buying a share here and there as the stock price fell because I do like bargains and this was a good opportunity for me to jump in. Remember that when you think you're done, you're not done. When you understand the business model of the company you want to invest in, research the business models of all other competitors as well. This is done by reading the annual reports for the business you're interested in as well as the annual reports for the business' competitors as well. So If company XYZ has 10 main competitors, research those 10 other competitors as well. In closing, the business model is a very key part of the research process, so start there if you're ever unsure where to start. Just that alone, will get you further than most people are willing to go.</p>
