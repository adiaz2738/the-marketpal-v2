                <p class="writing-text">Since I really like the topic of investing, I talk about it quite often in conversations with friends or other people I meet. One thing that comes up often and one that I definitely hear a lot from most people I talk to who don't invest, is "I don't know where to start" or "I never go into it". Being someone who is still trying to figure it all out and puts in a lot of time in order to figure it out, I do understand that it can be a bit overwhelming when you're first getting started, you're kind of interested in it, or you've just heard about it but you're not really sure what to do first.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"It looks too confusing"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I never got into it"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"It sounds boring"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"What if the market crashes?"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I don't know where to start"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I tried investing and I lost money" or</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I don't want to lose money"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">All of these things are just excuses in my opinion. Just because you don't know where to start, you've never done it before, or just because it looks or sounds very confusing at first, doesn't mean that it makes it a valid excuse for you not to actually try and get started. If you don't know what to do first, well, pick up a book on the subject, find out about the different routes you can take in the stock market, or watch YouTube videos on it.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text"><i>Quick side note, if you do choose to watch YouTube videos on the subject, it can definitely start to get overwhelming fast because everyone is trying to be the expert, sell you a course, and everyone seems to have their own style, and seems to have it figured out, which will only make you more confused. Some might not even give you enough information on the subject, they'll give you just a little taste of it and then tell that if you want to know more, to go and check out their $500 course. Don't over consume and use that as an excuse to not get started. Just start and start making mistakes, start learning from those mistakes, and that will help you improve.</i></p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Don't Know Where To Start, Do This</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">If you don't know where to start, then the first thing you can do is just open up a brokerage accounting. There's plenty out there to choose from such as TD Ameritrade (which is the one I use), Fidelity (has really good order executions), Charles Schwab, Robinhood, Acorns, and many more. Obviously, since I use TD Ameritrade, I'm going to recommend it because I really like it and I'll definitely make a blog about that in the future as to why I chose it over others. But I would also recommend Fidelity because it's very reliable and I've actually considered opening an account with them before. I would stay away from Robinhood if possible because they're not so reliable. Plus, it's taken me upwards of like a week for them to transfer the money over to my account so that I can use it and it'll take about the same if you want to transfer the money out of your account and into your bank account. But first thing's first, open up an account with a brokerage.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Educate Yourself</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The next thing you're going to want to do is educate yourself on the type of investing (or trading if you take that route) you want to do. Since I like value investing, I like watching a lot of Warren Buffett videos. I would sometimes spend hours and hours binge watching his videos, sometimes multiple times, in order to understand the principles he goes by when he's investing and how's he's managed to become the world's greatest investor. I highly recommend that whatever you're doing, you read books on everything related to that subject or even topics that aren't exactly about that subject, but may be related to it in some way. For example, if you go with value investing, then you might consider reading <a href="#resources"><i>The Intelligent Investor</i> by <i>Benjamin Graham</i></a> , which is Warren Buffett's favorite book of all time. But since you're on the topic of the stock market, and there's a lot of people who "invest" with emotion and ego, you might consider getting some books on psychology or something of the sort. A book I would recommend is one called <a href="#resources"><i>Ego is the Enemy</i> by <i>Ryan Holiday</i></a>. Try your absolute best to understand what you're doing and learn as much as you possibly can about that subject. I don't care how good you think you are, always have the mindset of a student, never stop learning because that will definitely harm you in the long run.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Start</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The next thing you can do is just start applying what you'd been learning and start investing. Start putting in the work, if you've gone for value investing, then great, start reading those annual reports, start doing all of the research you possibly can so you fully understand the businesses you're wanting to invest in, do everything you can, and if you really like that stock, you believe in it long term, and you're getting it at a good price, then great, buy it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Stop Being Afraid</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">I understand that it might be nerve racking but when it comes to the stock market, and this is something I learned the hard way, you need to have your emotions under control. If you're flipping over tables because you're stock when down 5% and you're down like $100 on the day, you're panicking, you're thinking short-term, and selling out for no reason, then the stock market isn't for you. Don't think short term if you're investing, but instead start thinking long term. Don't worry about what the volatility is today, tomorrow, next week, or next month. Another important thing that I've really started to see and realize for myself is the importance about not listen to other people, especially if they don't invest. For the record, I mean people that properly invest, not they bought some shares of some random stock because they saw the little chart moving up. Most people have no idea how the market works or what it's like to be an investor, they just see the doom and gloom and "what if the market crashes?" or "What if you lose money", just ignore all of that noise. Surround yourself with people who are like minded, open minded, who are on your level and are better than you so you're always learning from each other because you don't want to be in a situation where you've found a really nice company you really like, you invest in it and then uncle Tom says you should sell out because the market might crash, then you  do and the stock moves on without you. Think long term, not short term.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Be Patient</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The last thing you can do is be patient. Don't do the crap I was doing not too long ago when first started to invest, which was being desperate to get in some random stock because of FOMO,  don't worry about trying to hit a home run on every single pitch that comes your way. Be patient and wait for the perfect one. Someone with three amazing businesses will do better than someone else with 20 mediocre businesses. Put in the work, put in the time, be patient, and when you find something good, go for the swing.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">When you want to start investing or do anything else in life, from what I've come to learn so far, is that the best thing you can do for yourself is to just start. Get educated on what you want to do and start right away. Start doing the actual thing you want to do, not just learning about it for ages, thinking about it, or "planning." All you're really doing is procrastinating because you don't want to start. The reason for this is often because there's something in your mind that's getting in the way and it's always you. It's rarely every "the market" or so and so holding you back, it's just you being afraid to start because you're afraid to make mistakes and you're afraid of failure, more than you're excited about succeeding. The best thing you can do is to learn and start. Start making mistakes and learning from them because no matter how many Warren Buffett videos you watch. If you don't start reading those annual reports and finding a good business to invest in, you're never going to get anywhere.</p>
