                <!-- Main Blog Content -->
                <p class="writing-text">Annual reports are probably what take up most of my time when it comes to investing. Warren Buffett, who I talk about quite a bit, and will continue to talk about him and his teachings in the future, always preaches that investors should be reading as many annual reports as they possibly can.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">The Purpose</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Annual reports give you a summary of what happened in the business for an entire fiscal year. The 10-k is a more detailed version of this and details the company's business model, strategies, management's thoughts on the business and their approach, their competitors, risk factors, their financial position for that year, revenues and other financial data, and guidance for the upcoming year, among other data and metrics. These annual reports, 10-K's, 10-Q's, earnings calls, proxy statements, press releases, articles, old videos of management doing interviews, etc. (all of which can be found online) can all tell you everything you need to know about that business for you to decide whether that business is a good investment or not. Publicly traded companies are obligated to disclose all of this very important information about their business to the public and do it honestly. But there is still a good number of crappy businesses out there that are poorly managed by incompetent or corrupt people, so this is why you really need to research the stocks you want to buy.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">So this also means that not only will you be doing all of this research for the businesses you're interested in investing in, but you'll have to do the same thing with all of their competitors as well that are publicly traded, whose information you can find publicly. So yes, this process does get long and tedious, especially if you're a slow reader like myself.</p>
                <p class="writing-text"><i>(If that is something you struggle with as well, I do have a blog post with some possible solutions that I've put into action myself when researching stocks and trying to get through all of this reading!)</i></p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">What Even Is The Point of Going Public?</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Now, I understand that many people don't like reading, led alone having to read annual reports, which for most people can be quite boring. So yes, it may not be as glamorous as looking at fancy charts, with a bunch of indicators, the flashing numbers and words from the Time & Sales, Level 2, or the Active Trader, like a trader would be looking at. Investing is very fundamental because you're looking at the fundamentals of the underlying business of that stock. Many people often forget that a stock is more than just a line that moves up and down on a chart,  you're buying ownership in a business. However, this doesn't mean that if you buy 10 shares of AAPL, that you all of a sudden own a $1 trillion company, but you own a very tiny piece of that business, you're a shareholder. When a business wants to raise money (although businesses can go public for different reasons), that business will go public through an initial public offering (IPO), and it's stock, however much the owners have decided, can be purchased by the public, in exchange for a fancy stock certificate (Not something you'll receive these days with today's technology). The vast majority of the shares are owned by members of management, funds, very wealthy investors, conglomerates (like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway), etc. Either way, you're buying part of a business, so you should treat it as such and INVEST like you're buying the entire business (like Warren Buffett preaches). You wouldn't buy an entire $1 trillion dollar company, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), then sell it for less than you bought it for if the market is down big tomorrow, so why would you do that with any amount of shares you buy? That's why it's also important not to sell out at a panic when a stock drops in price in a correction or even a recession. If you've done your homework on a business and you choose to buy some shares of that company's stock, then you shouldn't have to worry if the stock drops 8% tomorrow, because you'd know you've made a good investment. A good business should allow you to sleep at night, even in a recession scenario. Many people like to treat the stock market like a casino where they throw money into some random stock because it's going up and they see people making money, whether it's on social media, their friends, or whatever, then are quick to panic sell when it drops, because they gambled rather than investing in a stock and they don't know what the hell to do.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Investing vs. Gambling</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">It's important to read these annual reports when you're investing in a stock. This is very different from gambling. Gamblers like to think that they're either trading or investing, but in reality are doing neither.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">If you're not doing the research and putting in the work to fully understand that business to the best of your ability, you're just gambling because not only do you not know what you're doing, but since you don't know how the business operates, the competition, risk factors, financial strength of the business, or anything about it for that matter, other than, "Oh, well the stock's moving up", you will have no idea when to abandon the ship if it starts to sink, you won't know when or if you should take profits, and you'll be far more likely to be tempted to panic sell when you shouldn't be selling. </p>

                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">A stock that's moving up today, could fall 5% tomorrow. A stock you think is good today because other people are throwing money at it, could go bankrupt tomorrow. Most people in the market are gamblers rather than investors or even traders. This is why it's important to read those annual reports because you need to understand what's going on with that business, things such as the management team because you want to invest in a business that is being run by honest and competent people, it's financial position because you want a business that won't go bankrupt in a recession, it's advantage in the market because you would want a business with is ahead of the competition and has a moat, you want to know how much that stock can return to you over the next 10 years or so, in comparison for what you've paid for it, among many other factors that can vary from business to business or industry to industry. Those annual reports should tell you everything you need to know about that business and help you decide whether or not it's a good investment. You must invest, not gamble! You can get one step closer to being the best investor you can be, rather than the luckiest gambler you can be, by reading reading reading! It might not be the most exciting thing in the world, I know, but it's necessary and there's no way around that if you want to be a good investor.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Could There Be An Exception?</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">However, there could be times when the market drops big (which a lot of people wait around for) and you've found some stocks that you really like and you want to put some money in those stocks. This is something I did during the COVID-19 pandemic, I bought shares of stocks I hadn't done the full research on but intended to do it as soon as possible. I bought shares while prices tanked and dollar cost averaged as they dropped further. The main reason why I did this was because I know that you can't predict a recession and when stocks dropped, I saw it as an opportunity to buy stocks I've been wanting to buy, but where to expensive when the market was at all time highs. Further into the crash, prices really got cheap, every stock I wanted to buy was very undervalued in the market, and I just bought and bought. Of course, I kept cash on the side because that's very important, you never want to be in a situation where prices drop or they drop further than they already have and you have no money to invest. You also don't want to put your money into a stock or various stocks all at once because they could continue to fall and you'd have no more money to continue buying as prices fall in order to lower your cost basis. Doing this could be a pretty good idea because finding bargains is extremely easy in a bear market, everything is cheap, and the vast majority of stocks are bound to go up when the market starts to recover, making it a very favorable time to buy. But again, even though you got a bargain, please research what you've purchased, although, again, you should have ideally done your research before you buy. Do avoid buying random stocks because of FOMO, buying random penny stocks just because you can buy more shares, or just because you're getting a bargain. Ensure it's a good investment before you buy, or that you're buying one of the no brainer stocks, like GOOG, AAPL, or FB if you haven't done the full research yet.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The stock market is a place where investors and traders like to go and make their living. Don't be the gambler that just wants shortcuts, asking people who do put in the work for what they invest in so you can copy them and holding onto stocks you don't actually know anything about. You might get lucky a few times but eventually Mr. Market will reclaim what you've earned. If you invest in something just because someone else bought that stock, when will you know to get out or when not to sell out? If that person is no longer there for you to copy, where will you go, who else will you copy? What if that person makes a bad investment? Will you blame them for your own ignorance? Or will you take action and put in the work to be the best investor you can be, so you don't have to go through any of these scenarios? Remember that you need to understand what you're investing. If you don't, even if you win on that stock, it's basically like not studying for a test and passing it, but as we've all had to experience in school, that luck eventually runs out. The market does not have mercy on anyone, so don't expect it to, just put in the work.</p>
