                <p class="writing-text">Today, Tesla released their second quarter earnings for fiscal year 2020. There's some cool stuff coming up for the comany and something to be excited about as a shareholder of the company.</p>
                <p class="writing-text"></p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Financials</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">We're starting with what most people came here for, the financial results. Tesla's EPS destroyed expectations of $0.03 and $-2.53 at the lowest, with earnings per share of $2.18. This fantastic to see and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that, as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA" target="_blank">Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA)</a> is soaring after hours, hitting $1,716.47 for a brief moment.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="../blog-posts/b-img/Tesla-5-minute-chart-screenshot-after-hours.PNG" alt="Tesla stock on the 5 minute chart on Think or Swim platform">
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">The company posted a profit again for the fourth consecutive quarter despite a lot of challenges that the company had to face during the quarter, the shutdown of their factories for half the quarter, being one of them. This cause a significant increase in costs The company had a positive Free Cash Flow of $418 million as shown in their Q2 2020 update slides.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">This was possible because of the company's decision to temporarily reduce employee compensation expense and other fundamental operational improvements.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="../blog-posts/b-img/fundamental-improvements-screenshot-tesla.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Q2 2020 Update slides">
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">As of this quarter, there has been an increase of $535 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which now stands at $8.6 billion. Tesla has been doing a very good job over the years of improving their financial strength and it is definitely in both their cash position and their net income. However, Elon did mention in the earnings call, which you can listen to at ir.tesla.com, that huge profits isn't the priority at Tesla, but rather small profits in order to just stay profitable and not go bankrupt, innovation, and making their vehicles more affordable. Elon did say in the earnings call that it bothers him that the cars aren't affordable. He also said this about it, "We will not succeed in our mission if we do not make the cars more affordable. So because of this reason, which Elon has talked about before in the past, that he doesn't really care too much about profits, I choose to pay less attention to that and more of the overall growth of the company. Of course, I also want the company to be profitable because I wouldn't want it to go bankrupt and I would like them to have a strong financial position for the same reason, but Elon's vision goes way further than just how much Tesla's making in three months.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Coming Up</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Tesla also touched on their new factories they will be building. Tesla added in the summary on page three of their slides that they will be building three new factories in three different continents at the same time.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="../blog-posts/b-img/three-factories-in three-continents.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Q2 2020 Update slides">
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">Elon talked a few times about the new factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin, Germany that should be completed by the end of the year, according to Musk. Another thing he brought up quite often is that they really need people to work for them, so if you would ever want to work at Tesla, hit em' up. Tesla Semi and Roadster will be made here in the U.S in the Austin factory.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">Tesla has also announced some updates on things such as the updated Model S that has a range of 402 miles. Tesla's energy business is also starting to see some good growth. On the "Other Highlights" slide of the update that Megapack generated a profit for the first time in Q2. Another big thing the company has done, is making solar more affordable, at $1.49  per watt. If you'd like to know more you can check out their <a href="#resources">Investor Relations</a> page that I've linked in the "Resources" section below.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Outlook</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Elon Musk said that the three new factories, Tesla Semi, Roadster, and self-driving will all be available by the end of the year. The company is still trying to stay on track to be delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2020, which they now have the capacity to do so. The great thing is that they have the sufficient cash flow to fund their product road map which should remove the need of having to take out any debt or needing to raise more capital.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Overall, the company is doing an amazing job to keep growing at the rate that they have and they have a very good vision for the future of the company. Most of the time, investors don't like the fact that Tesla isn't as focused on profits as other companies but this clearly isn't a big deal for Tesla, but they're rather heavily focused on growth and innovation. I'm glad to see this is the case and where the the company is headed with the products they're creating. This is part of the reason why I'm so bullish in the company long term. I would like the stock price to be cheaper so I can buy up some shares but who knows for how long this rally will continue. But in closing, this definitely was a solid quarter for the company.</p>
