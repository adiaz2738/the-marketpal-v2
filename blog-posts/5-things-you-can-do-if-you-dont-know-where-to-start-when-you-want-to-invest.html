                        <p class="detail-text-itl">7/17/2020</p>
                        <p class="detail-text-itl">Author: Anthony Diaz</p>

                </div>
                <p class="writing-text">Since I really like the topic of investing, I talk about it quite often in conversations with friends or other people I meet. One thing that comes up often and one that I definitely hear a lot from most people I talk to who don't invest, is "I don't know where to start" or "I never go into it". Being someone who is still trying to figure it all out and puts in a lot of time in order to figure it out, I do understand that it can be a bit overwhelming when you're first getting started, you're kind of interested in it, or you've just heard about it but you're not really sure what to do first.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"It looks too confusing"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I never got into it"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"It sounds boring"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"What if the market crashes?"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I don't know where to start"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I tried investing and I lost money" or</p>
                <p class="writing-text">"I don't want to lose money"</p>
                <p class="writing-text">All of these things are just excuses in my opinion. Just because you don't know where to start, you've never done it before, or just because it looks or sounds very confusing at first, doesn't mean that it makes it a valid excuse for you not to actually try and get started. If you don't know what to do first, well, pick up a book on the subject, find out about the different routes you can take in the stock market, or watch YouTube videos on it.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text"><i>Quick side note, if you do choose to watch YouTube videos on the subject, avoid overconsuming. Pick a couple people you want to watch and stick to that. I personally just watch Warren Buffett videos for the most part.</i></p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">1. Create a Brokerage Account If You Haven't Already</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">If you don't know where to start, then the first thing you can do is just open up a brokerage accounting. There's plenty out there to choose from such as TD Ameritrade (which is the one I use), Fidelity (has really good order executions), Charles Schwab, Robinhood, Acorns, and many more. I would personally recommend TD Ameritrade or Fidelity because those are the two I'm more familiar with and I personally use TD Ameritrade myself. I would stay away from Robinhood if possible because they're not as reliable as the others I've mentioned. An example of this would be when Robinhood went down on a historic day in the stock market during the peak of the panic due to COVID-19. You can take a look at the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/robinhood-app-down-again-during-another-historic-trading-day.html" target="_blank">CNBC article</a> if you're like to read more on that topic. Plus, it's taken me upwards of about a week for them to transfer funds from my bank account to he Robinhood account and it'll take about the same amount of time to transfer money from your Robinhood account back into your bank account. With brokerages like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade, your funds are ready to use right away.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">2. Educate Yourself</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The next thing you're going to want to do is educate yourself on the type of investing (or trading if you take that route) you want to do. Since I like value investing, I like watching a lot of Warren Buffett videos. You can also pick up some books on the topic that you're looking for. You can even purchase some books on topics that might not be directly related to investing, but can help you in some way when you start investing. For example, if you go with value investing, then you might consider reading <a href="#resources"><i>The Intelligent Investor</i> by <i>Benjamin Graham</i></a> , which is Warren Buffett's favorite book of all time. But since you're on the topic of the stock market, and there's a lot of people who "invest" with emotion and ego, you might consider getting some books on psychology or something of the sort. A book I would recommend is one called <a href="#resources"><i>Ego is the Enemy</i> by <i>Ryan Holiday</i></a>. Try your absolute best to understand what you're doing and learn as much as you possibly can about that subject (something I'm still working on). I don't care how good you think you are, always have the mindset of a student, never stop learning because that will definitely harm you in the long run if you start to become complacent, always keep learning.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">3. Get Started</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">This one might seem obvious, but one of the best things you can do is to just start applying what you've been learning and start investing. You're more than likely to make mistakes along the way and that's completely fine, as long as you learn from them, apply them, and move on. Start putting in the work, if you've gone for value investing, then great, start reading those annual reports, start doing all of the research you possibly can so you fully understand the businesses you want to buy, do everything you can, and if you really like that stock, you believe in it long term, and you're not paying too much for those shares, then great, buy it. Avoid procrastinating!</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">4. Don't Invest with Emotions, Think For Yourself, and Think Long Term</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">I understand that it might be nerve racking sometimes to new investors. But when it comes to the stock market, and this is something I learned the hard way, you need to have your emotions under control. Believe it or not, a lot of people in the stock market don't invest or trade, they speculate and buy and sell stocks with emotions. The most common emotions people feel are fear (fear of their stock falling or getting FOMO and buying when they shouldn't), greed, and ego. If you're flipping over tables because you're stock when down 5% and you're down like $100 on the day, you're panicking, you're thinking short-term, and selling out for no reason, then the stock market isn't for you. Don't think short term if you're investing, but instead start thinking long term. Don't worry about what the volatility is today, tomorrow, next week, or next month. Another important thing that I've really started to see and realize for myself is the importance about not listen to other people, especially if they don't invest. Learn to think for yourself and make your own decisions. Surround yourself with people who are like minded, open minded, who are on your level, and people better than you so you're always learning from each other because you don't want to be in a situation where you've found a really nice company you really like, you invest in it and then uncle Tom says you should sell out because the market might crash, then you do and the stock keeps rising without you. Think long term, not short term.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">5. Be Patient</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">The last thing you can do is be patient. Don't do the crap I was doing not too long ago when first started to invest, which was being desperate to get in some random stock because of FOMO.  Don't worry about trying to hit a home run on every single pitch that comes your way. Be patient and wait for the perfect one. Someone who puts their money in three stocks of amazing companies will do way better long term than someone who buys 20 mediocre or crappy ones. Put in the work, put in the time, be patient, and when you find something good, go for the swing.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">When you want to start investing the best thing you can do for yourself is to just start. Get educated on what you want to do and start right away. Start doing the actual thing you want to do, not just learning about it for ages, thinking about it, or "planning." All you're really doing is procrastinating because you don't want to start. The reason for this is often because there's something in your mind that's getting in the way. It's rarely every "the market" or someone holding you back, it's just you being afraid to start because you're afraid to make mistakes and you're afraid to fail, more than you're excited about succeeding. The best thing you can do is to learn and start. Start making mistakes and learning from them because no matter how many Warren Buffett videos you watch. If you don't start reading those annual reports and finding a good business to invest in, you're never going to get anywhere.</p>
