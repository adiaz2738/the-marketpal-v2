                <h1>Why I'm Interested in Fashion Stocks</h1>
                <p class="detail-text-itl">6/12/2020</p>
                <p class="detail-text-itl">Author: Anthony Diaz</p>
                <p class="writing-text">I’ve been very interested in fashion companies recently, includes companies in shoes, clothes, beauty products, etc. I’ve spent quite a bit of time browsing for good companies, with great balance sheets, that are profitable, and are run well. I’ve looked at companies such as Foot Locker, Revolve Group, Coty, Tapestry, and Capri. I’m currently researching Capri and I do intend on looking into Tapestry as well. Why have I been interested in fashion companies? Well, the easy answer is that people spend way too much money on it. We currently live in a world where people love things. Being someone who is young, I’ve noticed, especially on campus at the community college I’m attending for some accounting classes, that people love to spend money on things they don’t need but either make them look good, feel good, or it’s just enjoyable for them in some other way. These areas are makeup, shoes, clothing, cars, and accessories, such as watches, phones, and earphones, just to name a few. Technology is definitely one of the top areas people spend a lot of money on, regardless of whether they truly can afford it or not. This is why I’ve really been considering putting money into companies that make these products. Which is also one of the reasons why I put money into technology, and why I love Facebook so much, because Facebook and Instagram are where people go to show off these possessions. So if you’re putting money into both sectors, you’re looking at quite a bit of opportunity here, assuming you can pick out the winners, filter out the losers, and buy the winners at a good price.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">Let’s take a look at some research as to why I think the way I do. First off, if you read Facebook’s recent filings or listened to their most recent earnings call, you’ll find that Facebook has over 3 billion plus monthly active users (MAU) across all of their platforms. 2.6 billion on Facebook alone and Instagram is somewhere along those numbers as well. People love to make their lives public, they love to make everything they own public, and they love attention. This isn’t strange as we all like being noticed, and that includes me. People are willing to spend top dollar, to look like they have top dollar. I’m currently working on a research paper for Foot Locker, Inc., which I’ve recently purchased a couple of shares of. In that research paper, I talked about some research I did and some statistics I found about the shoe industry and why I think it’ll keep growing. Worldshoeliquidator.com reported that an average amount of shoes per person in the United States would be 19. They found that the average man has about 12 pairs of shoes, while the average woman has about 27 pairs of shoes! This is astonishing! This is just the number of shoes they have, not the number of shoes they’ve owned or the shoes they will continue to buy in the future. I see plenty of shoes these days going for something along the lines of $100-200, but let’s just say the average price for good shoes is $75. $75 x 12 pairs = $900, while $75 x 27 = $2,025. So $75 for the average pair per person, which is 19, would come up to $75 x 19 = $1,425.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">Make up is another big one. I’ve found a verity of numbers ranging from 5 to 6 figures, but theloop.ca reported in a study that the average woman will spend $300,000 on facial products in her lifetime. Again, I found estimates anywhere from 5-6 figures, but estimates that I found never went below 5 figures. This is from an average of 16 products woman apply every morning which includes, but may not be limited to, face wash, toner, serum, eye cream, moisturizer, primer, concealer, foundation, bronzer, blusher, eye shadow, eye, liner, mascara, eyebrow product, highlighter, lipstick, and there’s probably more, but these are what theloop.ca reported. Wow, incredible, that’s a lot of money when you consider the fact that this is just on their face alone. Only their face! This isn’t even counting the 27 pairs of shoes. This is a huge business with very high demand. The potential for good returns for an investor of one of these companies can be very formidable if the investor is able to pick a good company, with a strong financial positions, that is run well, and is profitable.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">Lastly, we have clothes, because if we kept going with everything there is on the list, this would go on for way too long and ain’t nobody got time for that. According to Credit Donkey, the average adult 25-34 spends $161 per month, which comes out to be $1,932 per year. 35-44 spend a bit more due to their incomes being higher on average. This is why I’ve been wanting to put more money into companies like Revolve Group if prices ever came back down below my cost basis. The potential for profit as an investor is quite high, when you pick the right businesses. This can be a challenge as well because a considerable number of these companies don’t really have the best balance sheets I’ve ever seen, which really makes me skeptical of how well they’d be able to handle a financial down turn. On one hand, you have companies like Revolve group, with a really good balance sheet, has ditched the old school forms of marketing, and has adopted the primary usage of online influencers and social media apps like Instagram, to market to the younger audiences that are more likely to spend more on fashion. They have gone the online route, rather than brick and mortar, which has actually allowed them to grow net sales up 6.4% from last year’s Q1 net sales despite the ongoing pandemic. Their strong balance sheet of $103.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and ZERO debt, leaves them in a very good financial position to endure most down turns in the economy and should allow you to sleep well at night. However, there are other companies with not so favorable financial situations, such as Coty, Inc., which hasn’t reported a profitable year since 2016, has $7 billion in long term debt despite only having a $3 billion market cap, and doesn’t have enough net income, since it’s negative, to cover the interest they have to pay on their borrowed money. This puts them at a higher level of financial risk, which may not be as attractive to some investors. But on the other hand, does have some very popular brands in its portfolio such as Gucci and Balenciaga. Anyone who enjoys rap music especially, knows about these brands. You do have to pick wisely on these brands, and I usually always go for the ones with strong financials, strong brands, and good management.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="writing-text">To summarize, companies in the shoe, apparel, and accessories sectors can definitely be a good potential investment. I have noticed how much money people love to spend on these things, and therefore, it’s something worth looking into for some potential bargains for good companies that can give me a good return in the long run. It’s very intriguing indeed and I will continue to look into these companies to try and find a good business I can trust and really like. We’ll see how that goes and I’ll definitely make sure to update as to whether I’ve found something worth purchasing in my opinion. But there’s some opportunity in this industry, especially with our current economic situations which have tanked the stocks of these companies, and even with this huge rally in the market, you can still find most of these companies at undervalued prices. Just takes time to find the good ones.</p>
