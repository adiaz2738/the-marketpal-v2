                        <p class="detail-text-itl">6/19/2020</p>
                        <p class="detail-text-itl">Author: Anthony Diaz</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="writing-text">Okay, so Warren Buffett is huge on reading, as those of us who follow him already know. He is big on reading annual reports to understand the business that you're investing in, but also reading ALL of the annual reports for their competitors as well. Now, for those of us who like value investing and have gone through these annual reports, 10-K's, 10-Q's, etc., you'll know these are very long! They can be upwards of 200 plus pages for a form 10-K, but I have seen some short ones that are at a more reasonable 70 pages long. But I think most of these would be the equivalent of an entire 5.5" x 8.5" book (since the pages on it would be smaller, it would take more pages.) So yeah, I don't know about you, but I'm not reading no book a day out here. Or even a book a week for that matter.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">So if you're someone like myself, who is a very slow reader, to which my reading speed doesn't crack 200 wpm (quite sad, I know). But I'm not the only slow reader out there by any means and I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only student of value investing that reads slower than a sloth can get down from a tree. So how then do you get through these very long (and boring for most people) annual reports?</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Just Read Faster</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Well, obviously, the first thing you could do, and should do, is to increase your reading speed. How can you do this you may ask? <i>Tim Farriss</i>, author of <i>Four Hour Workweek</i>, talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwEquW_Yij0" class="link" target="_blank">method for speed reading</a> that I found pretty cool and am trying to put into action myself. This can be done by doing a few things, though, before I talk about it, it is worth noting that this will work better on books, not a PDF of a form 10-K, though it could work if you choose to print out these forms. You can simply start by drawing 1 line after the first word on the left and before the last word on the right of the page. You can also skip the first 2 instead of the first one, or keep going if this still feels easy to you. What you'll do know is just read the text between those lines and don't read the words outside those lines. This doesn't mean that you should ignore them completely, but you won't be reading them necessarily, more so just look at the word and moving on. As you may have heard before, you don't really have to read words in a book to understand them. You can simply look at them and still understand the word and what it means. Almost like looking at a stop sign on the road. You don't necessarily read the word "STOP", but you just see the sign and you know what the word means by just simply looking at it. It'll also help if you use something like a pencil or your finger to underline the text as you go along to avoid re-reading the same thing (by the way I don't mean actually underline, as in draw a line under the words.)</p>
                <p class="writing-text">I'll link to two videos on speed reading in the resources section of this blog so you can check it out if you're interested.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">As I said, I've personally been trying to increase my reading speed with these techniques, so we'll see how well they work for me personally.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Adobe Acrobat DC</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Something that I've found recently which I'm experimenting with is Adobe Acrobat Reader. Adobe products are very useful in my opinion and you can get a lot of value out of them. However, just like the vast majority of Adobe products, you'll have to purchase it, it's not necessarily the cheapest solution out there, while reading faster is free. If you're a student, you can actually get the entire Adobe Suite for $19.99 a month, which is a pretty sweet deal if you ask me. If you're on a phone, you can get Adobe Acrobat reading, which is free, but you won't get very many tools other than some more basic ones for creating, editing, and reading PDF files. This is, essentially, what Adobe Acrobat DC is used for; sharing, collaborating, creating, editing, and reading PDF files. The cool thing about this piece of software though, is there "read out loud" feature. This tool, will read the PDF for you at the speed you choose, up to 450 wpm. You can have it read to you an entire PDF file, the page you're viewing at the moment, or a specific row of text. I personally have it set to 250 wpm, which is probably the equivalent of watching a YouTube video at 2x speed. I'm able to keep up with it quite well, helps me get through the report quicker, and it's pretty easy to use. Another cool thing about it is that it lets you highlight text, which I will do when I come across something that is interesting, important, or just stands out to me for whatever reason. It's not necessarily the best for reading the financial statements out loud, but it is pretty entertaining to listen to it try.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft Word</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">If you would not like to pay a monthly fee for software, I understand, and you could use something like Microsoft Word instead. It does have a "speak" feature which will read back text to you in a PDF file. The issue with this one, however, is that it's not as good as Acrobat's. It'll often mess up the alignment of the text since it'll have to convert the PDF into a Microsoft Word document, and it's also quite slow. It probably reads it at the same speed that I can read myself, which doesn't help me very much when trying to get through more annual reports. But if you couldn't be asked to read 200 pages, well this could still be pretty useful. But I do think it'll only read what you highlight with your mouse cursor, so you'll have to continuously highlight the text on new pages you want it to read. I wouldn't recommend highlighting every single page of course, because when it tries to read financial statements, due to it's alignment, it'll be quite difficult for it to do it properly, just read those on your own.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Google Speak It</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Alternatively, you can also use a Google Chrome extension called "Speak It", it's pretty useful. Not only will it read sections of a PDF that you highlight, but it'll actually for most things you highlight on chrome. You can Google something, and have it read to you by highlighting the text you want read to you, right click and click on "Speak It". You can also just go to the top right of your browser, right next to the search bar, and do it that way. It's pretty simple to use, you have some customization for tone, gender, rate (reading speed), among a couple other features. Although you can't type in a specific speed, it'll still allow you to choose between 5 reading speeds, ranging from "slowest" to "fastest". The reading speed "fastest" is probably around 250 or 300, something along those lines.</p>
                <p class="writing-text">If you're not on chrome, there's also one that I found called "Read Aloud", which will more or less, accomplish the same thing, and works with Chrome and Firefox. You could also just browse around for extensions on whatever browser you use, that will also give you the same result as these two I've mentioned.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="writing-text">Reading these annual reports, 10-K's, 10-Q's, etc., is very important. If you're anything like me, and want to become the best investor you can be, there is no way around it, you'll just have to put in the work and read those reports. If Warren can do it without anything but him brain and physical copies, you and I can do it with PDFs, text to speech, and patience. Hopefully this can help some people out there who are trying to put in the effort to read these reports, but are struggling to get through it all at a decent pace, with as little distractions as possible, and just getting it done.</p>
