                    <p class="writing-text">On 7/10/2020, Carnival Corporation released their earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Q2 earnings were worse than expected with adjusted EPS being at -$3.3 per share compared to -$1.83 per share that was expected.</p>

                        <h2 class="title-text-center">Carnival Corporation Releases Earnings For Q2 2020</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="writing-text">As of July 7, 2020, Carnival Corporation has released earnings for the second quarter of the 2020 fiscal year. There is quite a bit of information in their press release as well as in the 10-Q released by the company. After cruises coming to a complete halt for 3 months or so, it's fairly obvious that their business has been tremendously impacted.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cruises Resuming</h2>
                        <p>Carnival Corp does expect to be resuming operations in a phased manner. AIDA, the German cruise line that is a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation plans to resume operations beginning August 2020. According to Carnival, AIDA will be the first out of the company's nine cruise brands to resume their cruises.</p>
                        <p>The company will be getting rid of some of their ships in their fleet, having already sold one in June and five more are expected to be sold with 3 additional ships, which are expected to be sold within the next  90 days, according to their press release. Carnival Corporation has made big efforts to cut back on costs during the quarter due to their cruises coming to a complete stop, something that has never happened before as far as I'm concerned. The company has cut back on operating expenses of over $7 billion and capital expenditures have been reduced $5 billion  over the next 18 months as well. They have also been able to secure funding of over $10 billion and should be able to stay afloat for the time being. They have also borrowed $2.8 billion. Administrative expenses, non-newbuild capital expenditures and newbuild capital expenditures have been reduced by $1.3 billion and $600 million, respectively.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Financial Performance</h2>
                        <p>Revenues, as expected, were absolutely awful in comparison for last year in the three months ended March 31 with $446 million in revenues, compared to the same period in 2019 which was $3.3 billion! On the upside, as was stated in their press release, they cut back on a lot of expenses, which by my calculations was a drop of 21.4% in operating costs and expenses for Q2 2020 in comparison to the same quarter in 2019. This cut back in expenses was offset a bit by the increase of "ship and other impairments" costs to $589 million, compared to $0 in the same period last year. This is due to the complete stop of the cruises and the expenses of the book value of those ships being more than the company is getting back in cash flows (bad news). Another thing I noticed was the increase in "payroll and related" expenses. I assume this is due to the pandemic and and they said before, they have been working "around the clock," which would of course increase those payroll expenses because those people need to get paid for the time that is being put in to make sure the company doesn't crash and burn. Goodwill impairment is also much higher during this fiscal year, compared to last year with goodwill impairment being at $1.4 billion for the quarter, compared to last year's Q2 goodwill impairment expenses of $0. Again, this is because of the pandemic and the company must have made some bad investments that did not justify the price paid for those investments considering how poorly the company performed. This likely resulted in those goodwill impairments. This obviously ended up in a net loss for the Carnival Corporation of $4.4 billion compared to last year's Q2 of $451 million. EPS was absolutely terrible, as you'd expect, with adjusted EPS being -$3.3 per share, compared to the estimated -$1.83 per share that was expected. Although, you can't complain too much because this definitely could have been much worse had things gone differently for the company and with the COVID-19 situation as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Something that I do like to see is the amount of cash the company has on the balance sheet. Of course, the company did borrow money and they have been able to raise quite a bit of cash to keep them afloat for some time (no pun intended). Cash and cash equivalents are at $6.9 billion compared to cash and cash equivalents of $518 million in the same period last year. Short-term borrowings have increased a lot however and long-term debt has also increased quite a bit this year with short-term borrowings and long-term debt at $3.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, compared to the same period  last year, with short-term borrowings and long-term debt having been at $231 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Definitely a pretty substantial increase. I chose to use some fancy formulas. Of course, with this substantial increase in borrowings, it's a very good thing they have the cash on the balance sheet to pay that off over time, as well as the interest that goes along with it because they certainly do not have the net income to pay for that interest. If you wanted to know whether a company has a sufficient net income to pay for the interest that they owe on their borrowings, this could be found by finding the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), which I do have posted on the resources section of the website. These fancier formulas aren't absolutely necessary to make investment decisions. They're just metrics I like to use when I see something I'm curious to find or understand. So if a company were to have a lot of borrowed money and little net income, I'd like to know if that income is enough to pay the interest they owe so that company isn't defaulting on payments, if they don't have the cash on the balance sheet to pay for that interest. But again, it's not a must know metric for making investment decisions, just had to put that out there.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is still excitement around the potential resuming of operations of cruises which would probably explain why the stock price ended up rising instead of continuing the move to the downside that it's been making since it hit $25 per share last month. This could also be due to it being a psychological support level at $15 per share, which could also be a factor for traders.</p>

                        <p> Though I think it may be a little bit of both. Overall, I don't know what the future will hold for the company but I will continue to be a holder in the company's stock and see what happens. A lot of people have also entered into this stock as a bit of a speculative position or a post COVID stock play. There is quite a bit of risk here considering all of the terribly unfavorable scenarios this company has had to deal with so far this year and it's likely not gonna get better just yet. I do think it'll be a bumpy road to recovery, there's certainly a lot of to come and a lot more that the company is going to have to deal with. You just need to have a long term outlook on it, or at least try to have a long term outlook on things. You never know what the future may hold for this company, many others, or this COVID situation as a whole but we'll see as things progress.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><i>I will likely continue expanding on this over the next day or two.</i></p>
