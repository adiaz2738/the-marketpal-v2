                <p class="detail-text">As I say all the time, you need to understand a business before you invest in it. You do this by reading their annual reports. When you take a look at a company's 10-k that they will release annually at the end of the forth quarter of their fiscal year, one of the first things that will be on that form is the company's business model, what they do, what they're all about, how they do things, etc.</p>

                <p class="detail-text">I understand that it could be very nerve racking to see a stock that you've just bought go down big and it could be very tempting to sell to avoid a big loss. However, I think this is a very ineffective approach to investing and it's not very smart either.</p>

                <p class="detail-text">Warren Buffett, who I talk about quite a bit, and will continue to talk about him and his teachings in the future, always preaches that investors should be reading as many annual reports as they possibly can.</p>

                <p class="detail-text">Okay, so Warren Buffett is huge on reading, as those of us who follow him already know. He is big on reading annual reports to understand the business that you're investing in, but also reading ALL of the annual reports for their competitors as well. But what do you do when you're a slow reading trying to get through hundreds of pages a day?</p>

                <p class="detail-text">Fashion is an area where people love to spend. People will spend large amounts of money in things that make them stand out, make them look good, feel good, and boost their mood. When you're able to find a strong and powerful brand, find the winners in an industry, and stick with it long term if it's smart to do so, you're in for some good profits.</p>

                <p class="detail-text">Many people are told that diversification is a really good "strategy" for any investor. But what's the point in putting small amounts of money into a bunch of companies you don't understand if you know how to pick stocks? If you feel the need to diversify because a small portfolio doesn't let you sleep at night, either you need to sell those stocks or get better at analyzing businesses. More isn't always better when you understand what you have.    </p>

                <p class="detail-text">Big tech and gaming stocks continue their climb some of these companies benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Stocks like TTWO, that reported earnings of $1.07 per share when Wall Street was estimating $0.89 per share, going well above those estimates. In this blog I wanted to talk about gaming company earnings and my opinion on whether I think this momentum will last.</p>
