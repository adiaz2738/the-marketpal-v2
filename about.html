                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony, the creator of The MarketPal. I consider myself a student of the stock market and I wanted to create something where investors can come together to talk investing. This website is an outlet for me to share what I know and share the things I learn along the way in my journey to becoming the best investor I can be. I want people to see the process of what it's like, the work that goes into it, and what it takes to become a good investor. I'll share what I'm learning, where I'm learning things from, I share my portfolio, my thoughts, and ideas. I want other investors and people who want to learn to invest, to learn with me as I go along my journey, so we can all be the best investors we can be. Investing is awesome, it should be enjoyed and learned properly.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">What are the stock analysis research papers all about?</h2>
            <div class="basic-container">
                <p>Research papers don't have a specific publishing date. Whenever I find a stock I think is interesting and worth looking into, I'll write a multi-page research paper about the stock, why I'm looking into it, why I'm considering starting a position in it, why I already started a position in it, or why I'm not going to invest in it, if it's a stock I was considering in the past, or just wanted to give my opinion on it. These can be helpful to those of you who still don't know how to research companies, what to look for, and what to avoid, if you're just looking for a starting point on your own research, or if you're just curious about it. My research criteria follows a checklist of things I look for and I'll have a check mark on the aspects of the business are favorable and I'll leave the ones that could be improved or are unfavorable, blank. Valuing companies and figuring out whether or not they're a good investment, doesn't invlove anything too fancy, you do need to understand accounting, at least on a very basic level. I personally am no accountant either, but I am always trying to expand my knowledge on the topic. There is no need to understand overly complicated algibraic formulas, calculus, or any of that fancy stuff, just basic adding, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and you should be able to follow along just fine. I do try to make it as easy as possible to follow along and understand the information I'm covering, however, if there's something you do not understand, I have internal resources I've created myself, as well as some external sources from other websites to make it as easy as possible for you so you don't have to go on a journey all over the internet to find it. You can also email me with any questions you have about the research, as well as any feedback or suggestions. Feel free to leave any suggestions for stocks you'd like to see in a research paper in the future. If you are a Patron, and you do understand how to research companies, you can send me your own research paper on a stock you like, and I'll post it on here with your information, e.g. first name, last name, any contact info you want to provide, or link to your social media. The checklist of criteria I look for in any company includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>

                <p>Even though these analysis papers are meant to take a lot of the repetative and tedious work out of the equation to make it easier for you to get started on your investing journey or just save you some time in your day, I would still highly recommend you learn the concepts and information I go over and learn to do your own research as well, so you're not completely lost when reading through the analysis of a company. Information about the checklist of criteria I look for can be found on the "Resources" page on the website. Much more information and resources will be added as time goes on so you don't have to go on a hunt all over the internet to find the knowledge you need.</p>
